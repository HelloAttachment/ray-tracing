% Description:  Determines direction between two 3D points
% Inputs:       origin: start point of ray
%               termination: end point of ray
% Outputs:      direction_x: x-direction from start to end point of ray
%               direction_y: y-direction from start to end point of ray
%               direction_z: z-direction from start to end point of ray

distance = sqrt(direction(1)^2+direction(2)^2+direction(3)^2);
direction = direction/distance;

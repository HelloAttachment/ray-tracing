% Description:  Determines distance between two 3D points
% Inputs:       origin: start point of ray
%               termination: end point of ray
% Outputs:      distance: distance from start and end point of ray

direction = termination-origin;
distance = sqrt(direction(1)^2+direction(2)^2+direction(3)^2);
